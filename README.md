# NeuroSigViT

**NeuroSigViT** is a multimodal framework for wearable-sensor time-series
classification. It combines frozen CLIP ViT-H/14 visual representations of
sensor activity graphs with frozen Mantis-8M temporal representations, then
trains a lightweight fusion head and MLP classifier.

The maintained artifact focuses on `Shimmer_10_session10_AFC` and
`PADS_11_task08_TouchIndex`.

## Selected protocols

| Key | Dataset | Input | Split and endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shimmer10` | `Shimmer_10_session10_AFC` | `(N,6,4096)` | subject-level 69/23/25; HC versus MildPD/ModeratePD |
| `pads11` | `PADS_11_task08_TouchIndex` | `(N,6,976)` | subject-level 280/92/97 source split; Healthy versus Parkinson uses 212/70/73 after excluding OMD |

The fixed data-split seed is 42. The launcher seed, which controls model
initialization and result naming, defaults to 2022. Training-only statistics
are used whenever normalization is required. See `DATA_PROCESSING.md` for the
full protocol.

The local dataset directories and links are runtime inputs and are excluded
from anonymous source exports.

## Environment

Create an environment from the repository root:

```bash
conda create -n neurosigvit python=3.11 -y
conda activate neurosigvit
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The checked server environment uses Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.7.1, CUDA 12.6,
`open_clip_torch` 2.32.0, `mantis-tsfm` 1.0.0, and `transformers` 4.33.3.

## Checkpoints

The launcher accepts local checkpoint paths through `MODEL_DIR` and
`MANTIS_DIR`:

```bash
MODEL_DIR=/path/to/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K
MANTIS_DIR=/path/to/Mantis-8M
```

The corresponding public models are
[`laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K`](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K)
and [`paris-noah/Mantis-8M`](https://huggingface.co/paris-noah/Mantis-8M).

### PADS11 endpoint

The selected PADS experiment uses
`PADS_11_task08_TouchIndex`, the index-finger touching task from the
Parkinson's Disease Smartwatch (PADS) dataset. Each processed sample contains
six wrist inertial channels and 976 time steps. The fixed seed-42 split is
subject-disjoint and contains 280/92/97 source subjects in the
training/validation/test partitions.

For the reported binary clinical endpoint, only Healthy and Parkinson samples
are retained: `Healthy=0` and `Parkinson=1`. Other Movement Disorders (OMD)
samples are excluded without being merged into either class. This leaves
212/70/73 samples, with class counts 47/165, 15/55, and 17/56 for
Healthy/Parkinson in the three partitions. Channel normalization statistics
are fitted on the retained training samples only and then reused for validation
and test data.

Run only this endpoint with:

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/run_selected_dataset.sh pads11
```

## Running experiments

From the repository root, first print each command without starting training:

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/run_selected_dataset.sh shimmer10
DRY_RUN=1 bash scripts/run_selected_dataset.sh pads11
```

Remove `DRY_RUN=1` only after checking GPU availability. The convenience
wrappers are equivalent:

```bash
bash scripts/run_shimmer_example.sh
bash scripts/run_pads_example.sh
```

`GPU`, `SEED`, `EPOCHS`, `PATIENCE`, `RESULT_DIR`, `FEATURE_CACHE_DIR`,
`MODEL_DIR`, `MANTIS_DIR`, `DATA_DIR`, and `PYTHON_BIN` can be overridden as
environment variables. Additional `main.py` arguments may follow the dataset
key.

## Verification

```bash
python -m compileall -q main.py src data_loading scripts
bash -n scripts/run_selected_dataset.sh
python scripts/test_aaai27_datasets.py --data-dir data/Neuro
```

These checks cover the maintained Shimmer and PADS subject splits, clinical
endpoints, tensor shapes, label mappings, and training-only normalization.
